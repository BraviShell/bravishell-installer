* BraviShell Installer

This repository contains a bootstrap python script which will install a full
BraviShell development environment on your system.

* Access
You'll need to be a collaborator to do this. You should know who to email about this
already!

* Requirements
This installer has only been tested on MacOS 10.10---10.13 running Matlab 2017a+.
Other configurations may work, but are not guaranteed.

MacOS Mojave, and some very modern MacBooks, may not work properly with the openGL
tests as current written.

The =git= version control system must be installed and be relatively modern (2.0+)

* Use
To install in one shot:
#+begin_src bash
curl -L -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BraviShell/bravishell-installer/master/install_bravishell.py | python -
#+end_src

To do this manually:

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/BraviShell/bravishell-installer
cd bravishell-installer
python install_bravishell.py ../BraviShell
#+end_src
